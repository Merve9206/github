1-) What is JDBC?
- It stands for Java Data Base Connectivity.
- It is a java library that allows us to get connected with the database,
 get data from database and use the data in our automation codes

 2-) How do you use JDBC?
 - I create a connection with the database by using the credentials (url(hostname), port number, username and password) provided by the company.
 - then I send my query and get the data for that query and compare the data from database with the data from the UI or API
